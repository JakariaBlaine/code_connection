# What is Code Connection?

### What is Code Connection

Code Connection is an idea that spawned from a weekly Twitter chat hosted by [CodeNewbie.org](http://www.codenewbie.org).  Simply put, I see code connection as a way for people who code independently to find others to learn with, build projects with, bounce ideas off of, or whatever else you need to build up your code chops and/or projects.

### Why Do I Think There is a Need for Code Connection?

I have been working on learning how to code, in one way or another, for over 20 years.  I've done it mostly on my own, at home, but have taken a few courses at the local community college.  I attend Meetups locally but find them not that helpful in what I'm looking for, somewhat intimidating, or the groups in my area are barely active (The local Rails meetup has met twice in the past year for instance).  

I'm in my 40s.  I work 40+ hours per week, I'm married, I have a dog and four cats.  The time I have to work on my coding projects is limited to a few hours after work and weekend hours, but let's not forget a person needs to have a life, and if I want to keep my wife, I have to pay attention to her. 

A blog post on [Firehose Project](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/this-23-step-framework-will-help-you-finally-launch-your-side-project/) led me to start my [Twitter Account](http://www.twitter.com/mageeworld), and that has been very helpful.  I've connected with some people who are great, but it still doesn't fill the need(s), I've found that I'm looking for, but it has shown me that there are a plethora of people out there working to code, in so many languages or libraries, of all experience levels, age groups, desires, project goals, geographic locations etc...and, well, I think maybe there might be way to harness all that potential, no matter where it's located into building things that any of us want to build.

Thus the idea for this project came into my head.

The name Code Connection is not fixed, it is just the first name I came up with.

### What Do I want Code Connection to do?

I think it's pretty simple.  I want Code Connection to connect people.  I want people to be able to fill out not only a profile of their traits, qualities, but a profile of traits qualities they're looking for.  

Whether you need people to learn with who are learning the same code base as you, or someone more experienced than you in a different code base to help you solve a specific problem, or to learn that code base, you might be able to find someone available when you're available.

Perhaps like me, you're much better at back end work than front end work, but you want some help on the front end design of your proejct, put it out there for as little or as much as you want help with.  Maybe someone will guide you through wire framing, maybe someone will help you work through the concept of responsive design in bootstrap or flexbox.

Maybe, also like me, you've got big ideas for big projects (perhaps an SaaS system, perhaps a distributed social network with no owner, who knows), but you're still learning your ropes through deploying your application and haven't yet leared how to use ActionMailer (yeah, that's me right now), and you want to make connections with people who have different chops (but also have holes) who are looking for something to work on as well.

I could go on, but I think you get the general idea.  


### That's a Great Idea but How Would It Work?

Right now, this is just a kernel of an idea, but it's an idea I want to pursue, so I only have some broad strokes, but the idea works out something like this.

1.  Users Create a Profile and tell other users about themselves, but not any personal stuff, but more about you as a coder:
	* Libraries/Languges/Applications you know and the level you are at (be it Ember, Rails, or Adobe Illustrator, all skills would be welcome)
	* Methodologies you work in (or want to work in) (TDD, AGILE, others that I don't know the name off off the top of my head)
	* Avaiability in terms of days / time / etc...
	* Looking for categories (study buddies to work with, projects to do, layouts to help with, whatever)
	* And more would show up over time I'm sure

2.  *Searches* would be posted by users
	* I'm looking for people looking to learn Rails using Cucumber (that's a thing I promise) who are available M-F from 9-11 AM Pacific Daylight Time
	* I'm looking for UI/UX beginners who want to practice their chops on my project whose back end I'm in love with, but whose front end looks like a dog built it
	* Other stuff would evolve during the planning stage too


3.  Other Things - As They Occur to Me

### Some things I would want this to be

Free - this isn't about jobs or paid projects - I want people to find people they want to work with on Code Connection because they can't find the connection they need in a more traditional way
Inclusive - I know language translation stuff exists, and I don't know how to use it, but the more languages the application could speak the better.
Kind - There would be a very strict code of conduct and word usage filter - and violators would not be tolerated.

### What Do I Need?

Well that is a pretty easy question.  I need help.  Heck, perhaps this already exists and I haven't found it in my web trails.  If it does, just send me the link on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mageeworld), but if it doesn't and this sounds like a good idea to you, then still contact me on Twitter.  Let me know if you want to be included in any way shape or form.  If you just want to participate in helping set up the guidelines, please, the more input the better.  If you want to write some code, front or back end, let me know.  If you have some suggestions about how to build this, that would be great too.  I'm mostly a Rails, SQL guy...but I know there's a lot of different ideas and ways to peel a lemon out there (sorry, no cat skinning, like I said, I have 4 of them, and it really is an awful saying isn't it?), and I'm open to them all.  

Heck, if you have resources you think might be helpful let me know (for instance, it would be great if we could not only help people connect but give them a place to talk, or chat, or track their progress or projects, without little to now costs).  

Ok, I think I've gone on long enough.  If you are interested, or want to know more, you can find me on Twitter or you can email me directly at <admin@mageeworld.com>.

Thanks for *listening*
